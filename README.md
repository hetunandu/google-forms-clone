## Google Forms Clone

- The overall application is similar to google forms. There are three major functionalities of application:
  - A Form builder
  - Sharing, filling & submitting the form
  - Viewing the responses
- The form builderâ€™s UI is a list of input & non-input elements arranged in stacked from top to bottom of the page
- Each element could be either of
  - Static (Non input. Just static text)
  - Text (Input)
  - Radio
  - Drop down
- Form JSON
The form builder is be exportable as a JSON which could be parsed in future to generate the same UI again.
